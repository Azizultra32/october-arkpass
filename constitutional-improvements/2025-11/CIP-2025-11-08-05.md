## Constitutional Improvement Proposal (CIP) - 2025-11-08-05

**Proposal ID**: CIP-2025-11-08-05
**Submitted By**: Constitution Keeper (Session 7)
**Status**: DRAFT
**Addresses**: Gap 8.1 (CRITICAL) from OUTSTANDING_ITEMS_NOT_FOUND_IN_CONSTITUTION.md

### Problem Statement

**Issue**: The constitution references "when Ali unavailable" 6+ times but never defines what "unavailable" means, creating critical ambiguity for The Consigliere's temporary approval authority.

**Evidence**:
- Line 771 (Consigliere role): "If Consigliere unavailable → Prime assumes temporary Consigliere duties"
- Line 750: Consigliere "issues temporary approvals/denials (48hrs max OR next session) when Ali unavailable"
- Gap Analysis (lines 558-587): "Too aggressive ('Ali didn't respond in 10 minutes') → undermine Ali authority. Too conservative ('Wait 7 days') → block all work unnecessarily"

**Frequency**: Immediate - blocks The Consigliere from functioning properly in current Session 6 crisis

**Impact**: **CRITICAL** - The Consigliere's core function (temporary approval authority) cannot be exercised without knowing when to use it. Agents don't know whether to wait 10 minutes, 10 hours, or 10 days for Ali response.

### Current Constitutional Language

**Line 750** (Consigliere responsibilities):
> "Issues temporary approvals/denials (48hrs max OR next session) when Ali unavailable"

**Gap**: No definition of "Ali unavailable" exists anywhere in constitution.

### Proposed Solutions (3 Options)

#### Option 1: Status Quo (No Definition)
**Description**: Continue without formal definition, rely on Consigliere judgment for when Ali "seems unavailable"

**Pros**:
- Maximum flexibility for Consigliere to adapt to circumstances
- No rigid rules that might not fit all scenarios
- Agents can escalate urgently if truly blocked

**Cons**:
- Inconsistent application (different Consiglieres may use different thresholds)
- Risk of premature temporary approvals undermining Ali authority
- Risk of over-cautious waiting blocking time-sensitive work
- No accountability for Consigliere's "unavailable" judgment

#### Option 2: Simple Time-Based Threshold
**Description**: Define "Ali unavailable" as fixed time threshold (e.g., ">24 hours since last response")

**Proposed Language**:
```markdown
### "Ali Unavailable" Definition

**Ali Status**:
- **AVAILABLE**: Responded within last 24 hours → Consigliere MUST wait for Ali response
- **UNAVAILABLE**: No response >24 hours → Consigliere MAY issue temporary approvals

**Tracking**: Consigliere tracks time since last Ali response in SESSION_TIMELINE.md
```

**Pros**:
- Crystal clear threshold (no ambiguity)
- Easy to track and enforce
- Balances Ali authority (24hr wait) with work continuity (temporary approvals after)
- Accountable (SESSION_TIMELINE.md creates audit trail)

**Cons**:
- Inflexible (what if Ali said "away for weekend, back Monday" but 24hrs pass?)
- Doesn't account for urgency differences (critical security issue vs minor UI tweak)
- May cause unnecessary delays for time-sensitive non-critical matters

#### Option 3: Tiered Status System with Urgency Factors
**Description**: Multi-level Ali availability status with urgency-based escalation paths

**Proposed Language**:
```markdown
### "Ali Unavailable" Definition & Protocol

**Ali Status Levels**:
- **AVAILABLE**: Responded within last 4 hours → Normal operations, wait for Ali response
- **DELAYED**: No response 4-24 hours → Consigliere may issue temporary approval for **time-sensitive matters only**
- **UNAVAILABLE**: No response >24 hours → Consigliere may issue temporary approval for **all matters**
- **EXTENDED ABSENCE**: Announced absence >7 days OR no response >72 hours → Constitution Keeper activates Emergency Tribunal for major decisions

**Urgency Classification**:
- **TIME-SENSITIVE**: Blocks production deployment, critical security fix, or >3 agents waiting
- **STANDARD**: Normal governance decisions, constitutional amendments, role appointments
- **LOW-PRIORITY**: Cosmetic changes, documentation updates, process optimizations

**Status Tracking**:
- Consigliere tracks time since last Ali response in SESSION_TIMELINE.md
- Updates "Ali Status" in CURRENT_STATUS.md under Mission Control section
- Before issuing temporary approval, Consigliere MUST attempt Ali contact via all channels:
  1. Daily log flash message (red alert banner)
  2. Urgent flag in CURRENT_STATUS.md
  3. Royal Briefing filed in consigliere/briefings/

**Temporary Approval Rules**:
- DELAYED (4-24hrs) + TIME-SENSITIVE matter → Temporary approval allowed
- DELAYED (4-24hrs) + STANDARD matter → Must wait for UNAVAILABLE threshold
- UNAVAILABLE (>24hrs) + any matter → Temporary approval allowed
- EXTENDED ABSENCE (>7 days) → Emergency Tribunal for constitutional amendments, Consigliere handles routine matters

**Ali Override**:
- Ali may announce planned absence ("Away Nov 10-17") → immediately enter EXTENDED ABSENCE status
- Ali may delegate authority ("Consigliere authorized to approve Builder decisions for next week") → Consigliere documents delegation in SESSION_TIMELINE.md
```

**Pros**:
- Balances urgency with Ali authority (time-sensitive work not blocked unnecessarily)
- Flexible system accounts for announced absences vs unexpected delays
- Clear escalation path (Agent → Consigliere → Ali → Emergency Tribunal)
- Accountability through status tracking and mandatory contact attempts
- Prevents abuse (Consigliere can't claim "Ali unavailable" after 10 minutes)

**Cons**:
- More complex to administer (Consigliere must classify urgency)
- Agents might game system by claiming everything is "time-sensitive"
- Emergency Tribunal adds governance overhead for extended absences
- Requires SESSION_TIMELINE.md maintenance

### Constitution Keeper Recommendation

**Recommended Option**: **Option 3 - Tiered Status System with Urgency Factors**

**Rationale**:

1. **Balances Ali authority with operational continuity**: The 4-24hr "DELAYED" tier allows critical work to proceed while still respecting Ali's authority for routine matters. The >24hr "UNAVAILABLE" threshold is conservative enough to avoid premature temporary approvals.

2. **Prevents the current crisis from recurring**: Session 6 faced exactly this problem - no way to know if waiting for Ali was appropriate. Option 3 would have provided clear guidance ("Ali hasn't responded in 6 hours, but this is constitutional amendment = STANDARD urgency, so Consigliere must wait until 24hr threshold").

3. **Accounts for real-world scenarios**: Ali may travel, sleep in different time zone, take weekends off, or have emergencies. The "announced absence" provision allows Ali to delegate authority explicitly, while the >72hr threshold catches unexpected extended absences.

4. **Creates accountability**: Mandatory contact attempts (flash message, urgent flag, briefing) ensure Consigliere exhausts all options before exercising temporary approval. SESSION_TIMELINE.md audit trail allows Ali to retroactively review whether "unavailable" classification was justified.

5. **Option 1 is too risky** (no guardrails), **Option 2 is too rigid** (24hrs may be too long for critical security issues, too short if Ali just announced weekend trip).

### Constitutional Impact Analysis

**Affected Roles**:
- **The Consigliere** (primary user of this definition)
- **Constitution Keeper** (activates Emergency Tribunal during EXTENDED ABSENCE)
- **Prime** (backup Consigliere if Consigliere unavailable)
- **All agents** (understand when to expect temporary approval vs Ali decree)

**Conflicts with Existing Sections**:
- **RESOLVED CONFLICT**: Line 750 says "when Ali unavailable" but didn't define it → Option 3 provides definition
- **POTENTIAL CONFLICT**: Emergency powers (Constitution Keeper 12hr freeze, Consigliere 24hr quarantine, Adjudicator 4hr freeze) need to align with Ali Status system → Emergency Tribunal provision in EXTENDED ABSENCE handles this

**Version Bump Required**: **YES → v2.4.0** (major governance addition)

**Transition Plan**:
1. Consigliere immediately creates SESSION_TIMELINE.md with first entry: "Last Ali response: [Session 6 end timestamp]"
2. Consigliere updates CURRENT_STATUS.md with Ali Status section under Mission Control
3. All active agents notified via daily log flash message: "Ali Status tracking now operational - see SESSION_TIMELINE.md for current status"
4. No disruption to active sessions (this is pure addition, not breaking change)
