## Constitutional Improvement Proposal (CIP) - 2025-11-08-06

**Proposal ID**: CIP-2025-11-08-06
**Submitted By**: Constitution Keeper (Session 7)
**Status**: DRAFT
**Addresses**: Gap 2.3 (CRITICAL) from OUTSTANDING_ITEMS_NOT_FOUND_IN_CONSTITUTION.md

### Problem Statement

**Issue**: The Consigliere serves as SOLE interface between all agents and Ali, but constitution provides NO recusal protocol when The Consigliere has conflict of interest (e.g., judging own prior session's work).

**Evidence**:
- Gap Analysis (lines 164-196): "What if The Consigliere has conflict of interest? Example: Session 6 Consigliere adjudicating Session 5 Consigliere's own work."
- Line 771 provides backup ("If Consigliere unavailable → Prime assumes temporary Consigliere duties") but doesn't define "conflicted" as "unavailable"
- Self-referential paradox (ADJ-2025-11-08-01) nearly occurred with The Consigliere judging own work

**Frequency**: Will occur when:
- Consigliere's own prior session work comes up for review
- Consigliere has personal relationship with agent being judged
- Consigliere issued temporary approval that Ali now retroactively reviewing
- Consigliere drafted CIP that now requires Ali presentation

**Impact**: **CRITICAL** - Single point of failure: if both Consigliere AND Prime are conflicted, governance deadlocks. Without recusal rules, Consigliere's rulings lack impartiality (judging own work).

### Current Constitutional Language

**Line 771** (Consigliere backup):
> "If Consigliere unavailable → Prime assumes temporary Consigliere duties until Consigliere returns"

**Gap**: "Unavailable" undefined - doesn't explicitly include "conflicted due to conflict of interest"

**Lines 437-661**: The Consigliere role (230 lines) - no mention of recusal, conflict of interest, or impartiality requirements

### Proposed Solutions (3 Options)

#### Option 1: Status Quo (No Formal Recusal Rules)
**Description**: Trust The Consigliere to self-identify conflicts and recuse voluntarily when appropriate

**Pros**:
- Flexibility for Consigliere to handle edge cases
- No bureaucratic overhead
- Simple (no new processes)

**Cons**:
- No enforcement (Consigliere could ignore conflict)
- No accountability (no record of when/why recusal occurred)
- Unclear threshold (is "I worked on this 6 months ago" a conflict? What about "I supervised this agent last session"?)
- Single point of failure (if Consigliere doesn't recuse, nobody can force it)

#### Option 2: Simple Recusal Trigger List
**Description**: Define specific triggers requiring mandatory recusal, with Prime as backup

**Proposed Language**:
```markdown
### Consigliere Recusal & Conflict of Interest

**Mandatory Recusal Triggers**:

The Consigliere MUST recuse from a decision if ANY of the following apply:
1. **Prior Work**: Consigliere worked on the matter in a previous session (drafted CIP, made ruling, issued temporary approval)
2. **Personal Involvement**: Consigliere personally involved in the dispute (accused of violation, disputed with agent)
3. **Direct Bias**: Consigliere has stated opinion on the matter before case opened ("I think Builder X should be removed")

**Recusal Process**:
1. Consigliere declares conflict via daily log: "Recusing from [matter] due to [trigger]"
2. Prime assumes temporary Consigliere duties for THAT MATTER ONLY
3. Prime handles the conflicted matter, then authority returns to Consigliere
4. If Prime ALSO conflicted → oldest active Librarian assumes temporary Consigliere duties

**Permanent Recusal**:
If Consigliere recuses >3 times in 1 week → escalate to Ali for review (may appoint Second Consigliere)
```

**Pros**:
- Clear triggers (no ambiguity about when to recuse)
- Simple backup chain (Consigliere → Prime → oldest Librarian)
- Accountability (recusal logged in daily log)
- Prevents self-judging (prior work = automatic disqualification)

**Cons**:
- Only 3 triggers (may miss edge cases like "Consigliere mentored agent last month")
- No appeal if agent believes Consigliere should have recused but didn't
- "Stated opinion" trigger vague (does "I think that's interesting" count?)
- Doesn't address what happens if oldest Librarian also conflicted

#### Option 3: Comprehensive Conflict System with Appeals & Second Consigliere
**Description**: Expanded recusal triggers, agent appeal mechanism, Second Consigliere for high-conflict scenarios

**Proposed Language**:
```markdown
### Consigliere Recusal & Conflict of Interest Protocol

---

## Part 1: Mandatory Recusal Triggers

The Consigliere MUST recuse from a decision if ANY of the following apply:

**Category A: Direct Involvement Conflicts**
1. **Prior Work on Matter**: Consigliere worked on this specific matter in a previous session (drafted CIP, made ruling, issued temporary approval, adjudicated case)
2. **Personal Party to Dispute**: Consigliere is accused of violation, disputed with agent, or personally affected by outcome
3. **Agent Relationship**: Consigliere supervised/trained the agent in question within last 5 sessions
4. **Financial Stake**: (Future: if compensation introduced) Consigliere's compensation affected by outcome

**Category B: Impartiality Conflicts**
5. **Pre-Judged Matter**: Consigliere publicly stated opinion on matter before case opened ("I think X should be removed," "This CIP is clearly bad")
6. **Same-Session Work**: Consigliere worked on related matter in SAME session (can't draft CIP, then judge its own CIP)
7. **Ali Decree Interpretation**: Consigliere interpreting Ali decree that Consigliere personally drafted the briefing for (conflict in interpreting own framing)

**Category C: Appearance of Impropriety**
8. **Repeated Interaction**: Consigliere issued 3+ rulings about same agent within 10 sessions (pattern suggests bias)
9. **Agent ID Conflict**: Consigliere shares same Agent ID (from AGENT_REGISTRY.md) as the session being reviewed (self-referential conflict)

**Automatic Recusal**: Triggers 1-7 = AUTOMATIC (no discretion, Consigliere must recuse)
**Discretionary Recusal**: Triggers 8-9 = Consigliere may recuse if believes impartiality compromised

---

## Part 2: Recusal Process

**Step 1: Declaration**
- Consigliere declares recusal via daily log flash message:
  ```
  🔄 RECUSAL: The Consigliere recusing from [Matter ID] due to [Trigger Category + Number]. Prime assuming temporary duties.
  ```
- Updates `consigliere/recusals/RECUSAL-YYYY-MM-DD-NN.md` with details

**Step 2: Temporary Replacement**
- **Prime** assumes temporary Consigliere duties for THAT MATTER ONLY
- Prime handles: briefing Ali (if needed), issuing ruling, documenting decision
- After matter resolved, authority returns to Consigliere

**Step 3: Conflict Cascade (if Prime also conflicted)**
- If Prime ALSO has conflict on same matter → Oldest active Librarian by session count
- If oldest Librarian also conflicted → Second-oldest Librarian
- If all Librarians conflicted → **CONSTITUTIONAL CRISIS**: Activate Level 3 Emergency (Consigliere declares crisis, Ali intervenes)

**Step 4: Documentation**
- Temporary Consigliere documents all actions in `consigliere/temporary-replacements/TEMP-YYYY-MM-DD-NN.md`
- Links back to original recusal file
- Ali retroactively reviews all temporary replacement decisions (monthly review)

---

## Part 3: Agent Appeal of Non-Recusal

**If agent believes Consigliere SHOULD have recused but didn't**:

**Appeal Grounds**:
- Trigger 1-7 applies but Consigliere didn't recuse (mandatory recusal violated)
- Trigger 8-9 applies and agent can prove bias (discretionary recusal should have occurred)

**Appeal Process**:
1. Agent files appeal within 6 hours of Consigliere ruling via daily log:
   ```
   ⚖️ RECUSAL APPEAL: [Agent] appeals [Matter ID] ruling. Grounds: [Trigger violated]. Requesting Prime review.
   ```
2. Prime investigates: Reviews AGENT_REGISTRY.md, session logs, Consigliere's prior work
3. Prime rules within 12 hours:
   - **Appeal UPHELD** → Consigliere ruling VACATED, Prime re-decides matter as if Consigliere had recused
   - **Appeal DENIED** → Consigliere ruling stands, agent may NOT re-appeal (Prime's decision final)
4. If appeal upheld 2+ times against same Consigliere → escalate to Ali for Consigliere performance review

**Abuse Prevention**:
- Frivolous appeals (Prime denies as "no conflict evident") count as minor violation against appealing agent
- Agent who files 3 frivolous recusal appeals in 1 month → Adjudicator investigates for abuse

---

## Part 4: Second Consigliere Appointment (High-Conflict Scenarios)

**Triggers for Second Consigliere**:
- Consigliere recuses >3 times in 1 week (too many conflicts)
- Consigliere + Prime + all Librarians conflicted on same matter (cascade failure)
- Ali determines project has grown too large for single Consigliere (10+ Doors, 50+ agents)

**Appointment Process**:
1. Constitution Keeper recommends Second Consigliere appointment to Ali via Consigliere briefing (ironic but necessary)
2. Ali approves → appoints Second Consigliere
3. Second Consigliere has EQUAL authority to First Consigliere

**Division of Labor** (if two Consiglieres):
- **First Consigliere**: Odd-numbered Doors (Door-01, Door-03, Door-05...)
- **Second Consigliere**: Even-numbered Doors (Door-02, Door-04, Door-06...)
- **Cross-Door Matters**: Consiglieres collaborate, present joint Royal Briefing
- **Conflicted Matters**: If First conflicted, Second handles (and vice versa)

**Sunset Clause**:
- If Second Consigliere unused for 30 consecutive days (no matters assigned) → role sunsets automatically
- Second Consigliere may voluntarily retire if workload too low

---

## Part 5: Recusal Tracking & Metrics

**Recusal Registry**: `consigliere/recusals/RECUSAL_REGISTRY.md`

**Tracks**:
- Date of recusal
- Matter recused from
- Trigger category + number
- Temporary replacement (Prime / Librarian / Second Consigliere)
- Outcome of matter
- Any appeals filed

**Performance Metric** (Consigliere):
- **Recusal Rate**: <10% of matters = healthy (shows impartiality without excessive conflicts)
- **Recusal Rate**: >20% of matters = problem (suggest Second Consigliere appointment)
- **Upheld Appeals**: 0 upheld appeals = excellent (no missed conflicts)
- **Upheld Appeals**: 2+ upheld appeals = performance issue (Consigliere missing obvious conflicts)

---

## Part 6: Conflict of Interest in Other Roles

**This protocol applies to The Consigliere specifically**, but establishes pattern for other roles:

- **The Adjudicator**: Should recuse if personally involved in dispute (already implied by role, now explicit)
- **Constitution Keeper**: Should recuse from CIP review if Keeper drafted the CIP (obvious conflict)
- **The Twins**: No recusal needed (competitive design is THE POINT of the role)
- **Prime**: Recuses per Part 2 when assuming temporary Consigliere duties

**Future CIP**: If conflict-of-interest issues arise in other roles, Constitution Keeper will draft role-specific recusal protocols.
```

**Pros**:
- **Comprehensive coverage**: 9 recusal triggers cover all common conflicts
- **Agent protection**: Appeal mechanism prevents Consigliere from judging own work despite conflict
- **Scalability**: Second Consigliere handles high-conflict scenarios and large projects
- **Accountability**: Recusal tracking creates audit trail, performance metrics identify problem patterns
- **Cascade handling**: Clear chain (Consigliere → Prime → Librarian → Crisis) prevents deadlock

**Cons**:
- **Complex system**: 9 triggers, appeals, Second Consigliere, cascade chain, recusal registry
- **Overhead**: Tracking recusals, filing appeals, maintaining registry
- **Second Consigliere controversial**: Adds governance role (violates parsimony), may never be needed
- **Appeal abuse**: Frivolous appeals waste Prime's time (though abuse prevention helps)

### Constitution Keeper Recommendation

**Recommended Option**: **Option 3 - Comprehensive Conflict System with Appeals & Second Consigliere**

**Rationale**:

1. **Self-referential paradox proves need for rigorous conflict rules**: Session 5/6 crisis occurred because no agent caught the "Session 6 judging Session 5" conflict until too late. Option 3's Trigger #9 (same Agent ID = automatic recusal) prevents this.

2. **Consigliere's power demands stricter accountability**: The Consigliere has MORE power than any other role (sole Ali interface, temporary approval authority, consolidates all escalations). With great power comes great conflict potential. Option 2's 3 triggers are insufficient.

3. **Agent appeal is essential fairness mechanism**: Without appeal, if Consigliere wrongly refuses to recuse, agents have NO recourse except waiting for Ali to notice (could take weeks). Option 3's 6-hour appeal to Prime provides fast remedy.

4. **Second Consigliere is escape hatch, not daily overhead**: Most projects will NEVER appoint Second Consigliere (sunset after 30 days unused). But for massive projects (20 Doors, 100 agents), having the OPTION prevents governance bottleneck. Think of it as "break glass in emergency" provision.

5. **Option 1 is reckless** (no accountability), **Option 2 is incomplete** (no appeals, no cascade for "all conflicted" scenario).

6. **Recusal tracking enables continuous improvement**: By analyzing recusal patterns (which triggers fire most often, which matters cause most conflicts), Constitution Keeper can propose targeted CIPs to reduce structural conflicts.

### Constitutional Impact Analysis

**Affected Roles**:
- **The Consigliere** (primary - must recuse when triggered, maintain recusal registry)
- **Prime** (assumes temporary Consigliere duties when Consigliere recused, handles appeals)
- **Librarians** (serve as backup temporary Consigliere if Prime also conflicted)
- **Constitution Keeper** (monitors recusal metrics, may recommend Second Consigliere)
- **All agents** (may file recusal appeals if believe Consigliere conflicted)

**Conflicts with Existing Sections**:
- **RESOLVED CONFLICT**: Line 771 says "If Consigliere unavailable → Prime assumes duties." Option 3 expands "unavailable" to include "conflicted" (recusal = temporary unavailability).
- **POTENTIAL CONFLICT**: "SOLE interface between Ali and all agents" (line 869) vs "Second Consigliere has EQUAL authority" (Option 3). **Resolution**: Second Consigliere is OPTIONAL (only if >3 recusals/week or Ali appoints). When exists, both are "sole interfaces" (agents can go to either, but must pick one per matter).

**Version Bump Required**: **YES → v2.4.0** (major governance addition affecting Consigliere role)

**Transition Plan**:
1. Consigliere creates `consigliere/recusals/` directory immediately
2. Consigliere creates `RECUSAL_REGISTRY.md` with template entries
3. Consigliere updates Consigliere role section (lines 547-772) with Part 1-6 protocols
4. All agents notified via daily log: "Consigliere recusal protocol operational - see consigliere/recusals/"
5. No immediate recusals (agents get orientation on new triggers)
6. Second Consigliere appointment ONLY if triggers met (not appointed by default)
