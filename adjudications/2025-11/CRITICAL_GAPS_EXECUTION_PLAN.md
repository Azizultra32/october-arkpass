### HOUR 12-24: Ali Reviews & Issues Decrees

**Deliverables**: Decrees on 6 matters (1 + 5 CIPs)

**Review Method**: The Consigliere presents briefing → Ali selects options → Consigliere documents decrees

**Status**: ⏳ PENDING (waits for Consigliere briefing)

### HOUR 24-36: Constitution Keeper Implements Approved CIPs
**Owner**: Constitution Keeper
**Deliverables**:
- Updated ARKPASS_DEV_TENET_PRIME.md (v2.3.0 → v2.4.0)
- New supporting files (PRECEDENT_REGISTRY.md, etc.)
- Updated CURRENT_STATUS.md

**Implementation Order** (based on Ali decrees):

2. Create supporting infrastructure (registries, templates)
3. Version bump constitution

5. Announce in daily log + CURRENT_STATUS.md

### HOUR 36-48: Verification & Rollout
**Owner**: The Adjudicator + Prime
**Deliverables**:
- Constitutional compliance check (no contradictions)
- Agent notification (all active agents briefed on changes)
- Documentation complete (all 3 locations: constitution, CURRENT_STATUS, daily log)

**Status**: ⏳ PENDING (waits for implementation)

---

## CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS

### 1. Constitution Keeper MUST Start Immediately
**Action**: Next agent session claiming Constitution Keeper role drafts all 5 CIPs within 6 hours

**Template**: Use CIP template (lines 1003-1054 of constitution)

**Parallelization**: Each CIP can be drafted independently → possible to draft all 5 concurrently if multiple agents available

---

### 2. Consigliere MUST Consolidate & Present
**Action**: The Consigliere consolidates 5 CIPs + retroactive approval into single coherent briefing for Ali

**Format**: Royal Briefing template (lines 697-748)

**Presentation**: 3 options per matter (status quo, minor amendment, major reform)

---

### 3. Ali MUST Review Within 24 Hours
**Action**: Grandmaster Ali reviews briefing and issues decrees

**Format**: Select Option A/B/C for each matter + optional notes

**Criticality**: This is the bottleneck - if Ali unavailable >24 hours, Consigliere may need to issue temporary approvals for time-sensitive gaps

---

### 4. Implementation MUST Be Immediate Post-Decree
**Action**: Constitution Keeper implements ALL approved CIPs within 12 hours of Ali decree

**Quality Gate**: The Adjudicator verifies no contradictions introduced

**Rollout**: All agents notified via daily log flash message + CURRENT_STATUS.md update

---

## FALLBACK PLAN (If Ali Unavailable >24 Hours)

### Consigliere Temporary Approvals
**Trigger**: Ali no response >24 hours after briefing filed

**Temporary Approvals** (Consigliere authority, 48hrs max):
1. **APPROVE** CIP-2025-11-08-05 ("Ali Unavailable" definition) - **IMMEDIATE** (needed to resolve current crisis)
2. **APPROVE** CIP-2025-11-08-06 (Consigliere Conflicts) - **IMMEDIATE** (prevents self-referential paradoxes)
3. **APPROVE** CIP-2025-11-08-04 (Precedent Registry) - **LOW RISK** (pure documentation, reversible)
4. **HOLD** CIP-2025-11-08-02 (Emergency Powers) - **HIGH RISK** (authority changes require Ali)
5. **HOLD** CIP-2025-11-08-03 (Agent Identity) - **MEDIUM RISK** (affects succession, wait for Ali)

**Rollback Plan**: If Ali retroactively denies temporary approvals, Constitution Keeper reverts changes within 6 hours

## RISK MITIGATION

### Risk 1: Constitution Keeper Unavailable
**Mitigation**: The Consigliere can draft CIPs (lower quality but functional)
**Backup**: Oldest active Librarian assists Consigliere with CIP drafting

### Risk 2: Consigliere Unavailable
**Mitigation**: Prime assumes temporary Consigliere duties (constitutional line 771)
**Backup**: If Prime also unavailable, oldest Librarian assumes duties

### Risk 3: Ali Extended Absence (>48 hours)
**Mitigation**: Consigliere issues temporary approvals per Fallback Plan
**Backup**: Emergency Tribunal activated (Constitution Keeper + Consigliere + Prime + oldest Librarian)

### Risk 4: CIP Quality Too Low
**Mitigation**: The Adjudicator reviews each CIP before briefing filed → flags deficiencies
**Backup**: Constitution Keeper revises CIPs based on Adjudicator feedback (adds 2-4 hours to timeline)

### Risk 5: Implementation Introduces Contradictions
**Mitigation**: The Adjudicator catches contradictions during Hour 42 verification
**Backup**: Constitution Keeper immediately fixes contradictions before rollout (adds 2-4 hours)

---

## SUCCESS METRICS

### Timeline Adherence
- **CRITICAL**: All CIPs drafted within 6 hours (50% on-time delivery)
- **HIGH**: Royal Briefing filed within 12 hours (75% on-time)
- **MEDIUM**: Ali decree within 24 hours (depends on Ali availability)
- **HIGH**: Implementation complete within 36 hours (90% on-time)

### Quality Metrics
- **CRITICAL**: Zero constitutional contradictions introduced
- **CRITICAL**: All 3 locations updated (constitution, CURRENT_STATUS, daily log)
- **HIGH**: CIPs address root cause of gaps (not just symptoms)
- **MEDIUM**: CIPs follow established constitutional patterns (consistency)

### Outcome Metrics
- **CRITICAL**: Ali approves ≥80% of proposed CIPs (validates Constitution Keeper judgment)
- **HIGH**: Constitutional gaps reduced from 23 → <10 (major progress)
- **MEDIUM**: No new gaps introduced during implementation (careful drafting)
