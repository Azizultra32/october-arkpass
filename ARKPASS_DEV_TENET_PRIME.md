## 🚨 Critical Blockers & Open Questions

### 1. INVIC-headless Schema Inspection 🔴 URGENT
**Status**: Not yet inspected
**Blocker**: Need actual schema to validate field mapping assumptions
**Action Required**: Run `scripts/EXTRACT_SCHEMA.sql` in INVIC-headless Supabase SQL Editor
**Who Can Do This**: Developer with Supabase access to INVIC-headless project (gqahazcatpgzzfujnidk)

### 2. Eight OpenSpec Proposals Needed 🟡 HIGH PRIORITY
**Status**: Identified but not created
**Proposals Required**:
1. Dual-mode date system (affects ALL features)
2. Supplements table (entire feature missing from INVIC)
3. Allergy safety fields (category, severity, requires_epipen)
4. Document management system (folders, tags, associations)
5. Condition type system (Chronic vs Transient)
6. Immunization dose parent-child relationships
7. Social history enhancements (CAGE assessment, recreational drugs)
8. Personal info extended demographics

### 3. Missing Figma Screens 🟡 MEDIUM PRIORITY
**Status**: Referenced in navigation but not extracted
**Screens Needed**:
- Calendar screen (bottom nav icon exists)
- Account/Profile screen (bottom nav icon exists)
- Quick Add menu/modal (center plus button destination)
- Note entry screen (for adding visit notes)
- Revoke access confirmation modal
- Custom period date picker

### 4. Home Screen Design Update 🟢 JUST RAISED
**Status**: User indicated possible redesign
**Current**: Dashboard with sharing cards + health record grid
**Future**: To be determined
**Action**: Wait for user input on new design vision

## 🎓 Knowledge Base: Key Decisions

### Design Philosophy
1. **ArkPass Schema is PRIMARY, FHIR is SECONDARY**
   - We optimize for patient UX first, FHIR export second
   - Custom fields allowed when FHIR doesn't fit patient needs

2. **Date Input Innovation: Dual-Mode System**
   - Patients can enter dates OR ages ("May 2020" or "When I was 25")
   - Stored as JSONB with precision/certainty metadata
   - Computed columns for efficient queries
   - Display columns for patient vs provider views

3. **Color-Coded Access Code Lifecycle**
   - 🟨 Yellow = Active (in use)
   - 🟧 Orange = Unused (generated but not used)
   - 🔲 Gray = Pending (awaiting questionnaire or generation)
   - ⚪ White = Expired/Revoked

4. **Bottom Navigation Pattern**
   - 5 icons: Home, Calendar, Plus (center/primary), Key, Account
   - Always visible except during questionnaire flows
   - Plus button = Quick add (opens modal/menu)

### Database Conventions
- `{field}_raw` = JSONB storage (date/age/relative time)
- `{field}_computed` = TIMESTAMP generated column (for queries)
- `{field}_display_pt` = TEXT generated column (patient view: "May 2020")
- `{field}_display_pr` = TEXT generated column (provider view: "05/15/2020 (uncertain)")
- Soft delete: `deleted_at TIMESTAMP` (never hard delete)
- RLS: Row-Level Security on all patient data tables

### Tech Stack
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (Supabase)
- **Backend**: (To be determined)
- **Frontend**: React + (styling TBD - Figma shows Tailwind but needs conversion)
- **Auth**: Google OAuth, Apple OAuth, Mobile Phone + SMS
- **Design System**: Public Sans font, 24px H1, 20px H2, 16px body

---

## 🔧 Development Environment

### Supabase Projects
- **INVIC-headless** (gqahazcatpgzzfujnidk): Production database
- **Dev/Staging**: (To be confirmed)

### Required Tools
- Supabase CLI (currently v2.22.12 - may need update)
- Git
- PostgreSQL client (for local testing)
- Figma Desktop app (for MCP server screen extraction)

## 📝 Standard Operating Procedures

### For New Agents Joining Mid-Project

1. **Read ARKPASS_DEV_TENET_PRIME.md** (this document) - MANDATORY
2. **Check Agent Activity Log** - See what the last agent did
3. **Review DATABASE_FILES_INDEX.md** - Understand all 33 files
4. **Clock In** - Add your session to Activity Log
5. **Check Blockers Section** - See if anything is blocking progress
6. **Start Work** - Follow the task breakdown in openspec/changes/.../tasks.md
7. **Update as You Go** - Keep Activity Log current
8. **Clock Out** - Commit your session summary
9. **Push to GitHub** - So next agent can see your work

### For Planning/Design Work

1. Check if design decisions exist in `openspec/changes/fhir-database-harmonization/design.md`
2. Check if specs exist in `*_SCREENS_SPECS.md` files
3. Check field mapping in `INVIC_VS_ARKPASS_FIELD_MAPPING.md`
4. If creating NEW design, document decision rationale
5. Update relevant spec files
6. Update this document if architectural change

### For Implementation Work

1. Check migration scripts in `scripts/` directory
2. Check if database functions exist (`dual-mode-date-functions.sql`)
3. Run migrations in dev environment first (never production directly)
4. Follow validation checklist in `SCHEMA_VALIDATION_CHECKLIST.md`
5. Test dual-mode date fields with sample data
6. Document any issues in Activity Log

### For Figma Screen Extraction

1. Check if screen already extracted (11 spec files cover 91 screens)
2. Use Figma Desktop app + MCP server
3. Get screenshot + design context + variable definitions
4. Convert Tailwind to project's actual styling system
5. Document in `*_SCREENS_SPECS.md` format (see existing files)
6. Update `DATABASE_FILES_INDEX.md`

---

## 🚀 Recommended Next Steps (Priority Order)

### Immediate (Do First)
1. **Inspect INVIC-headless schema** - Run `EXTRACT_SCHEMA.sql` to validate field mapping
2. **Clarify home screen redesign** - Get requirements from user
3. **Test dual-mode date functions** - Run test queries in dev Supabase

### Short-term (This Week)
4. Create 8 OpenSpec proposals for schema conflicts
5. Build Phase 1 migration scripts (create missing tables)
6. Set up dev Supabase project for testing
7. Implement RLS policies

### Medium-term (This Month)
8. Build API endpoints (auth, access-codes, visit-notes, questionnaires)
9. Build frontend components (authentication screens)
10. Build dashboard with access code cards
11. Implement bottom navigation

### Long-term (Future)
12. Complete all 111 tasks in `tasks.md`
13. Extract missing Figma screens (Calendar, Account)
14. Implement all 10 PHR features
15. FHIR export functionality
