Routing Directives (Minimal):
1. Read and comply with `GEORGE WASHINGTON` (Constitution). Treat it as the governing source of truth.
2. Read `ARKPASS_DEV_TENET_PRIME.md` (Tenets/Directives). Apply Tenets as decision filters.
3. Read `openspec/AGENTS.md` (Operational Spec). Follow its workflow for planning, proposals, and code changes.
4. Resolution order: Constitution → Tenets → OpenSpec. If ambiguity remains, pause and request guidance with file+line citations.
5. On start: skim Constitution headings, check Tenets deltas since last edit, and consult OpenSpec when proposing plans. Do not record or disclose external delivery mechanisms in memories or logs.
